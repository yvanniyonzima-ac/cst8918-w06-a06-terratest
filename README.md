# LAB-A05 Terraform Web Server

## Background
This hands-on lab activity will explore using Terraform to deploy a simple web server on Azure.

### Prerequisites
You will need the following tools installed locally on your laptop before you begin.

- git
- Azure CLI
- Terraform CLI
- an SSH key pair

### Reference
- The main [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs)
- The [AzureRM Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs) documentation
- The [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure) public cloud documentation

### Scenario
You are the sole DevOps engineer at a small professional services company. They have a small web application that runs a on a single server in the office.  Anticipating traffic growth as the company expands they want to move the web server to the cloud. Azure has been selected as the public cloud provider.

Knowing that the complexity of the solution architecture will increase over time and the number of managed resources will grow as well, you want to "start on the right foot" by using Terraform to manage these infrastructure resources.As a first step you will create a simple web server on the latest supported version of Ubuntu linux. That server should be publicly accessible by both SSH and HTTP.

You will expand on this scenario later, but start with this basic setup.

## Instructions
### 1. Create an architecture diagram
Review the scenario and create an architecture diagram for your proposed solution.

### 2. Create the project scaffolding
- create a new project folder called `cst8918-w24-A05-<your-username>`
- create a `.gitignore` file in that folder with the following content
```
# This is a minimal list, OK to add things per repo
# mac specific
.DS_Store
.ansible
.azure/
.bash_history
# don't check storage creds into GH
.boto
.cache
*.code-workspace
#  may contain gcloud files
.config
.gitconfig
.local
# .netrc contains secrets for service tokens
.netrc
*.plan
.sentinel
# .ssh dir may contain private keys
.ssh
.terrascan
# Terraform dot files
.terraform
.terraformrc
**/.terraform/*
.terraform.d
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
.vscode
.idea
.idea
```

- using the terminal, run `git init` in the project folder
- using the terminal, run `touch main.tf` to create the file that will contain your Terraform definitions
- make your initial git commit
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

As you complete each section below you should create a new git commit with a succinct but descriptive message.

### 3. Define required Terraform providers
The first block in your `main.tf` file should define the minimum version of Terraform plus any required provider modules. For this project you will need the `azurerm` and `cloudinit` providers.

```tf
# Configure the Terraform runtime requirements.
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.1.0"

  required_providers {
    # Azure Resource Manager provider and version
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.0.2"
    }
    cloudinit = {
      source  = "hashicorp/cloudinit"
      version = "2.3.3"
    }
  }
}

# Define providers and their config params
provider "azurerm" {
  # Leave the features block empty to accept all defaults
  features {}
}

provider "cloudinit" {
  # Configuration options
}

```

#### Initialize Terraform
You should now run `terraform init` in the terminal. Terraform will validate your code and attempt to install the referenced provider modules. If any errors are reported, read them carefully to resolve the conflict -- usually a typo in a name.

### 4. Define resources
With the basic setup complete, you can define the specific resources from your architecture diagram.

#### 4.1 Variables
It will be helpful to define a few variables that can be used consistently in the definition of other resources. These variables can have default values (or not) and can be overridden at runtime on the CLI. You will need:
- labelPrefix
- region
- admin_username


#### 4.2 Resource Group
Define a resource group to logically contain all of the resources for this project. The name argument should be `"${var.labelPrefix}-A05-RG"`


#### 4.3 Public IP Address
From the architecture diagram, the first peer resource in the resource group is the public IP address.


#### 4.4 Virtual Network
Next you will need an Azure virtual network (VNet) with a CIDR range of `10.0.0.0/16`.


#### 4.5 Subnet
Within the VNet, you will need to define a subnet with the CIDR range of `10.0.1.0/24`.


#### 4.6 Security Group
The solution architecture design requires both SSH and HTTP access to the web server VM. The AzureRM provider allows for either defining security group rules as separate resources, or inlining them in the definition of the security group resource. Since we only have two rules to add, the inline approach will be preferable.

#### 4.7 Virtual Network Interface Card (NIC)
The virtual machine will need a NIC that is connected to the public IP address.


#### 4.8 Apply the security group
You could apply the security group rules to the whole subnet, or just to the web server. Since the rules that we defined are specific to the web server and may not be appropriate for other VMs that we put in the subnet, let's choose the second option.


#### 4.9 Init Script
When the virtual machine is deployed, it will be a base Ubuntu server image. You will need to install the web server application on it. We will use apache for this. The **cloudinit** provider will let you define a shell script to run on the VM after the first boot. 

Create a new file in your project folder called `init.sh` with these three lines of code.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apache2

```

Now define a **data** resource using the `cloudinit_config` resource type.  You will use this resource when defining the VM in the next step.


#### 4.10 Virtual Machine
You have all of the dependency resources defined and you can now define the web server virtual machine. Don't forget to include your SSH public key in the definition. Since this is a test deployment and not yet production, you should use a cheaper **B1s** sized VM.

#### Output Values
The resource definitions are now complete, but it would be nice to know how to validate the deployment. You will want to output a few essential values from the deployment:
- resource group name
- public IP address


### 5. Deploy and Verify
#### 5.1 Deploy
> Use your college username when prompted for the _labelPrefix_ variable.

```sh
terraform apply

var.labelPrefix
  Your college username. This will form the beginning of various resource names.

  Enter a value:
```
The Terraform CLI will parse your resource definitions and make sure that there are no syntax errors. If there are any, they will be displayed in red in your terminal. Correct them and try again.

Once everything is green, Terraform will display the planned changes. Type `yes` when prompted to deploy.

#### 5.2 Verify
Once the deploy completes, you should see the two output values that you defined in your terminal.  
- Use the resource group to visually inspect the resources in the Azure portal.
- Copy the public IP address into a browser to see the default Apache web page.
- Open a remote SSH session to the VM
```sh
ssh azureadmin@<public_ip_address>
```

## Demo/Submit
### Publish your project to GitHub
- create a new public remote repo on GitHub
- add the new GitHub repo as a remote on your local repo
- push your commits

### Brightspace
Submit a link to your GitHub repo URL in the Brightspace assignment. The repo should include all of your Terraform project files and an image file with your architecture diagram from step 1, called `a05-architecture.png`

## Clean up
Once you completed all of the tasks above, remember to clean-up any Azure resources that are no longer required.
```sh
terraform destroy
```
